During a hot summer in remote Cuca Macaii, six friends decided to go to a lonely cabin in the woods for relaxation. As they arrived there, they realize the 
owner left them a list of chores to do before they can kick back. Choose your character:
1. Usher
2. Idk
3. Clork

Idk enters the house and decides to start with his chores immediately.Your  set of chores involves:
    - starting the fire in the Soba
    - going to the basement to retrieve an acient wine (you may not be alone in the basement)
    - chop some wood to keep the fire lit in the Soba
    - make some sarmale



You chose to go to the retrieve the ancient wine of the owner, because nothing works better with sarmale than wine
(except sour cream). As he said , you may not be alone there. But since you are a brave one, you decide to go down the stairs
. As you enter the pitch black of the basement, you start to hear some strange noises sounding like scratches. 
You have 2 options now: 
    - go back upstairs and never return
    - go back upstairs and pick a flashlight to check what s happening there


You chose to go back upstairs and never return. Good job! All of your friends resent you and the owner slapped you when he returned
for your check out.

You chose to pick a flashlight and explore. As you enter the basement again, you feel more curious about what s happening down there
You turn on your flashlight and see that the only things in the basement are some barrels with tuica and a very dusty door
that has "Wine" written on it. As you approach the door you start hearing the strange sounds again. There is nop going back 
this time so you open the door. Surprised
