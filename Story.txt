During a hot summer in remote Cuca Macaii, six friends decided to go to a lonely cabin in the woods for relaxation. As they arrived there, they realize the 
owner left them a list of chores to do before they can kick back. Choose your character:
1. Usher
2. Idk
3. Clork

Idk enters the house and decides to start with his chores immediately.Your  set of chores involves:
    - starting the fire in the Soba
    - going to the basement to retrieve an acient wine (you may not be alone in the basement)
    - chop some wood to keep the fire lit in the Soba
    - make some sarmale


You chose to start the fire, did you chop wood?

-Yes

-No

You decided to cut wood, while searching for the axe you notice its not where the owner left it it was on the ground next to a puddle of deep reddish dark
liquid, the urge to step back is strong, what do you do?

-Step Back

-Continue

You accept to go back and never look back when you arive you call the police and lock yourself in the car. The police arrives and they tell you they found 
traces of blood leading to the car. One cop tells you to get out of the car and put your hands up, while the other looks shocked, you dont understand but 
comply. After they handcuff you and lift you of the ground you notice the bloodstain on the ground, left by your clothes. You dont understand why you are
covered in blood but the cops find the axe in the car stained with your friends blood that was left where the wood was.


You ignore the overwhelming feeling you have and go check what was going on. Luckly it was just a bottle of wine that had spilled over you get the axe and
start chopping some wood. You find it wierd how you are sweating so much. after you cut the wood you slowly carry it back inside and try to start the fire.


As you start the fire you feel a wierd smell from the chimney, you realize that you didnt chop wood and whatever you were burning was not what you tought.
