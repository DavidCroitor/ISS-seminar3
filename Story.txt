During a hot summer in remote Cuca Macaii, three friends decided to go to a lonely cabin in the woods for relaxation. As they arrived there, they realize the 
owner left them a list of chores to do before they can kick back. Choose your character:
1. Usher: go to line 9
2. Idk
3. Clork

Usher reads his list of chores and picks one to do first. They all seem as easy as one another:
- sweep the patio
- clean the backyard toilet
- wipe the windows
- collect wood for the campfire
