During a hot summer in remote Cuca Macaii, six friends decided to go to a lonely cabin in the woods for relaxation. As they arrived there, they realize the 
owner left them a list of chores to do before they can kick back. Choose your character:
1. Usher
2. Idk
3. Clork

You start wandering what you should start with, suddenly a wierd noise comes from the basement.
