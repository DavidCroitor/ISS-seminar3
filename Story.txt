During a hot summer in remote Cuca Macaii, three friends decided to go to a lonely cabin in the woods for relaxation. As they arrived there, they realize the 
owner left them a list of chores to do before they can kick back. Choose your character:
1. Usher: go to line 9
2. Idk
3. Clork

Usher reads his list of chores and picks one to do first. They all seem as easy as one another:

- sweep the patio
- clean the backyard toilet
- wipe the windows: go to line 38
- collect wood for the campfire: go to line 15

Collect wood for the campfire: Usher puts on some work boots he found in the shed and with his purpose in mind, sets out in the nearby woods to collect 
branches, logs and the like. The woods are chilly and quiet but Usher isn't one to scare away so easily. Usher still hasn't found any suitable wood but he 
spots a small river with a wood bridge going over it. Do you: 
- cross the bridge? go to line 23
- try to go around? : go to line 21 

After seemingly walking for an eternity with no end in sight, an evil forest spirit jumps from behind the trees and kills you. (go back to line 9 to retry)

After crossing the humid wood bridge and walking a bit further, Usher finds himself in a nice open field with some conveniently placed dry wood logs near 
a big rock. Do you:
-pick up as many logs you as you can carry and return to the cabin? (go to line 31)
-pick up only one log and collect some branches on your way back? (go to line 33)
-become content with the idea of a small campfire and return only with a few branches? (go to line 29)

You only picked up a few branches and will leave your friends dissatisfied with the campfire tonight. You didn't die tho. That's good. (go to line 35)

God is sickened by your greed and smites you down. You died, sinner. (go back to line 9 to retry)

You pick up the single log and nothing happens. You got: A Nice Big Log! (go to line 35)

Congrats! Task done. Return to line 9 to pick another.


Wipe the windows: Usher tries to find some cleaning supplies in the shed. As you're searching the shelves for some solution and some tissues, you spot in the 
corner of your eye a shadowy figure from the shed window. What do you do?
-ignore it: go to line 43
-look over at it:

Whatever that was lunges at you and kills you. (go to line 9 to try again)

Whatever that was dissapeared. You grab the cleaning supplies and return to clean the windows. 
Congrats! Task done. Return to line 9 to pick another.


Sweep the patio: The cabin has a small patio, and it takes a short time to sweep, but it can be a bit tricky. Usher takes the sweeper from the kitchen and goes
outside to the patio.There he sees a piece of medium-rare steak, that looks appetizing:
    -eat the steak(go to line 22);
    -leave it there(go to line 24);
    -throw it away(go to line 29).

Eat the steak: The steak was poisonous and Usher dies.

Leave it there: The steak looks suspicious and Usher leaves it there. Usher then continues to sweep the patio, trying to not think about that steak. A time goes 
by and Usher finishes sweeping and looks again at the steak:
    -eat the steak(go to line 22);
    -throw it away(go to line 32).

Throw it away: The steak looks suspicious and Usher throws it away. Usher then continues to sweep thinking about that ohter chore that he has. WHO IN THEIR RIGHT
MIND STILL HAS A TOILET IN THE BACKYARD, WHAT IS IT 1950?!? After he finishes sweeping he goes to clean the toilet(go to line 35).

Thorw it away: The steak looks suspicious and Usher throws it away. 'WHO IN THEIR RIGHT MIND STILL HAS A TOILET IN THE BACKYARD, WHAT IS IT 1950?!?' Usher thinks
 After that he goes to the backyard to complete the other chore (go to line 35).

Clean the backyard toilet: The toilet was far from the cabin, and the walk took about 2 minutes. On the way there he thinks, 'Why did i accept this one?'. When 
he got closer to the toilet, he thought he saw a figure running behind the trees:
    -it's just in his head(go to line 40);
    -investigate.

It's just in his head: Usher tries to dismiss the figure, saying that is just an imagination but cannot calm down because he knows he is alone in this part of the
property and the others will not hear it if he screams. He enters the toilet in order to clean it and hears a frightening sound coming from the woods.Die from heart attack!

Investigate: Go in the woods and the figure attacks Usher and Usher dies.
